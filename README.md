# SEIS664-Team3

## SEIS 664 Lab 5

This repository contains a basic example of weighted shortest job first work ordering, compared with an attempt to make the same amount of work more "efficient" by taking up less time. The results, as calculated by the python script in this repo, show the potential major loss of revenue by attempting to reduce the amount of wasted time by teams.

Please note that the script is tightly coupled to the included sheet - it is NOT a universal calculating script. As a quick and dirty exploration tool contains a number of poor programming practices.

With that said, the repo DOES include a pipfile for creating a Python virtual environment if you wish to give it a try. You must have `pipenv` installed to make use of this. Once that is complete, you can run the script in the following manner:

1. `pipenv install`
2. `pipenv shell`
3. `python main.py` (Substitute your python alias here if necessary)
